# Simulation of a noisy channel with three-bit-repetition encoded messages

This repo contains Julia code that explores the accuracy of various decoding strategies
for three-bit-repetition encoded messages. The problem is explored via both Monte Carlo simulation
and analytical formulas. The Julia code can be found in the `three_bit_repetition.jl` file. A
report that summarizes the results can be found in [the wiki](https://github.com/CameronBieganek/three-bit-repetition/wiki/Simulation-of-three-bit-repetition-encoding-on-a-noisy-channel).
